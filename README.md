# Data Visualization with Python
Hello, and thanks for stoppying by. This project is a place for me to
experiment with data-centric python libraries.

The projects are currently organized in directories/folders by library.
Here's a brief overview by directory:

*Matplotlib* will be used to create a set of visualizations. I will include
a screen shot of the visualization in the matplotlib viewer for quick reference.

*Ploty* will be used to create a set of interactive visualizations.

## Dependencies
-Python
-Matplotlib
-Ploty

## Contributing
I will mostly likely not accept any contributions due to the nature of this
project. However, I am always open to constructive criticism and/or conversation.

## Acknowledgments

* A special thank you to *Eric Matthes*, author of *Python Crash Course*.
